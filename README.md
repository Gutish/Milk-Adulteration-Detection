# Milk-Adulteration-Detection
This repository showcases a machine learning-based approach to detecting and quantifying extraneous water adulteration in milk. It builds upon the research conducted at the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research, published in Food Analytical Methods (Asefa et al., 2022). The original work explored the feasibility of image analysis coupled with machine learning for this purpose (https://doi.org/10.1007/s12161-022-02352-w). This project expands on that research by implementing and evaluating the machine learning models for both detection and quantification of added water in milk samples.
Image analysis and feature extraction procedures were implemented using ImageJ software. Using extracted image features, exploratory analysis and implementation of different machine learning algorithms were performed using Solo (Eigenvector Research, Version 9.0) software in the published version of the analysis. However, I would like to use python from scratch and showcase the analysis in this repository.
In this analysis, I will try to implement different ML packages and compare their performance for the intended objective.
